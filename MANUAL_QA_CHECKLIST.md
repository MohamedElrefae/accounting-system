# Manual QA Checklist - User Management System Consolidation

## ✅ Pre-Testing Setup

### Database Verification
Before testing, verify your database has the required schema. If needed, request SQL for schema verification:

```sql
-- Example verification query (request from user if schema validation needed)
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('user_profiles', 'roles', 'permissions', 'user_roles', 'role_permissions');
```

### User Accounts Required
Ensure you have test accounts with different permission levels:
- [ ] Super admin account
- [ ] Regular admin with user management permissions
- [ ] Limited user without user management access
- [ ] Test user accounts for CRUD operations

---

## 🔐 Access Control & Navigation Testing

### Super Admin Access
- [ ] **Navigation**: Side menu shows "User Management" entry (Arabic: إدارة المستخدمين)
- [ ] **Route Access**: Navigate to `/settings/user-management` - should load successfully
- [ ] **Unified Interface**: Single tabbed interface with 4 tabs:
  - [ ] المستخدمين (Users)
  - [ ] الأدوار (Roles) 
  - [ ] الصلاحيات (Permissions)
  - [ ] طلبات الوصول (Access Requests)

### Limited User Access
- [ ] **Permission Gating**: User without `users.view` permission should:
  - [ ] NOT see "User Management" in navigation menu
  - [ ] Get "Access denied" message when visiting `/settings/user-management` directly
- [ ] **Graceful Fallback**: Error message should be user-friendly, not technical

### Legacy Route Redirects
Test that old bookmarks still work:
- [ ] `/settings/users` → redirects to `/settings/user-management`
- [ ] `/settings/roles` → redirects to `/settings/user-management`  
- [ ] `/settings/permissions` → redirects to `/settings/user-management`
- [ ] Redirect should be seamless (no broken pages or loading errors)
