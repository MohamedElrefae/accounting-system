- **Context Preservation**: Panel stays open while performing actions
- **Reduced Clicks**: Actions accessible without navigation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators and feedback

### ✅ Developer Benefits
- **Reusable Component**: Can be used in other parts of the application
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uses existing DraggableResizablePanel and UnifiedCRUDForm
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Common Issues to Watch For
1. **Variable Conflicts**: Fixed `submitNote` variable name conflict
2. **Permission Checks**: Ensure proper permission validation
3. **Data Refresh**: Verify data refreshes after operations
4. **Memory Leaks**: Check for proper cleanup on unmount
5. **Performance**: Monitor performance with large audit trails

## Rollback Plan
If issues are found, the old TransactionView can be restored by:
1. Reverting the import in Transactions.tsx
2. Reverting the details panel rendering code
3. The old TransactionView.tsx file remains intact as backup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] New features work as designed
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] No accessibility issues
- [ ] Consistent with design system
- [ ] User feedback is positive
