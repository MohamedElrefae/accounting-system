## 🗄️ **Database Setup Status**

Since your database tables and functions already exist, the system should work immediately. However, if you encounter any issues, run this verification:

### **Quick Database Check**
```sql
-- Copy and paste this in your SQL editor to verify everything is working:

SELECT 'ROLES' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM roles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'PERMISSIONS', COUNT(*) FROM permissions  
UNION ALL
SELECT 'ROLE_PERMISSIONS', COUNT(*) FROM role_permissions
UNION ALL
SELECT 'USER_ROLES', COUNT(*) FROM user_roles;
```

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **✅ Basic Operations**
- [ ] View roles in cards view
- [ ] Switch to table view
- [ ] Search for a role by name
- [ ] Sort roles by different criteria
- [ ] Create a new role
- [ ] Edit an existing role
- [ ] Assign permissions to a role

### **✅ Advanced Features**
- [ ] Select multiple roles for comparison
- [ ] Use comparison view to see permission differences
- [ ] Duplicate an existing role
- [ ] Use context menu (right-click on role card)
- [ ] Export role data
- [ ] Test permission assignment with live saving

### **✅ Security Testing**

- [ ] Test that system roles cannot be deleted
- [ ] Confirm RLS policies are working (users see appropriate data)

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you see permission errors:**
```sql
-- Run this to check your superadmin status:
SELECT is_super_admin();

-- Should return 'true' if you're properly set up as superadmin
```

### **If role data doesn't load:**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies are working:
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'roles' AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Should show 'rowsecurity = true'
```

### **If permission saving fails:**
```sql
-- Test the save function directly:
SELECT save_role_permissions(1, ARRAY['users.read', 'users.create']);

-- Should return a JSON result with success status
```
