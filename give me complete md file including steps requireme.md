- **Frontend components** in Arabic with RTL support using React + Vite
- **User interface** matching your design with dark theme and Arabic text
- **Permission management system** with granular role-based access control
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, roles, and permissions through UI
- **Security implementations** including rate limiting, input validation, and audit logging


## **What You Get:**

1. **Database Schema** - Complete SQL scripts for user profiles, roles, permissions, and audit logs
2. **Authentication Components** - Login form matching your design with social login options
3. **Permission System** - Granular control with UI for managers to change roles and permissions
4. **Admin Interface** - Complete user management dashboard with permission matrix

The system allows managers to change roles and permissions through an intuitive UI interface, includes self-service user profile management, and provides enterprise-grade security suitable for construction company requirements. All components are production-ready with proper error handling, validation, and security measures.
