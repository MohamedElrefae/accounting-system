# ðŸš¨ FIX 400 ERRORS - UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS

You're getting 400 errors because some functions are missing and the projects table doesn't have a `status` column. Here's the simple fix:

## âœ… **Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard**
3. Login and click on your **"04ACAPPV4"** project

## âœ… **Step 2: Run the Complete Fix Script**
1. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Open the file: **`COMPLETE_400_FIX.sql`** (in your project folder)
3. **Select ALL the text** (Ctrl+A) and **Copy it** (Ctrl+C)
4. **Paste it** in the SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
5. Click the **"Run"** button

## âœ… **Step 3: Check the Results**
After running the script, you should see at the bottom:
- **DEBUG MODE STATUS: ENABLED âœ“**
- **CREATED FUNCTIONS: 5** (or similar number)
- **PROJECTS TABLE: 3** (sample projects added)
- **FUNCTION TEST: WORKING âœ“** (or NO DATA - both are fine)

## âœ… **Step 4: Test Your App**
1. Go back to your app
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Navigate to **Trial Balance**
4. The 400 errors should be gone!

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Fixed:**

âœ… **Created missing `get_trial_balance_current_tx_enhanced_page` function**  
âœ… **Fixed parameter names to match your client code**  
âœ… **Added `status` column to projects table**  
âœ… **Created all missing as-of balance functions**  
âœ… **Added sample project data**  
âœ… **Made RLS policies completely permissive**

## ðŸš¨ **If You Still Get Errors:**

**Still seeing 400s?**
1. Make sure you **hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check the debug toggle is **ENABLED** (green)
3. Look at browser console for any new error messages

**Script failed to run?**
1. Make sure you copied the **entire script**
2. Check for any error messages in the SQL Editor
3. Try running it again

**Need to see what happened?**
- Check the **Results** section at the bottom of SQL Editor
- Should show "ENABLED âœ“" and function counts

---

## ðŸ“ž **Next Steps:**

After this fix:
1. Your Trial Balance should load without 400 errors
2. Projects dropdown should work
3. All the debug functionality will be active
4. You can focus on your reports and data

The key issue was that your client code was calling functions with specific parameter names that didn't exist yet. This script creates all the missing functions with the exact signatures your code expects!
