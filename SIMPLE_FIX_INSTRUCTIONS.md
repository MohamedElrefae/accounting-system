# ðŸ”§ SIMPLE DATABASE FIX - STEP BY STEP

The database connection error happened because the CLI couldn't connect to your remote Supabase project. Here's the simple fix:

## âœ… **Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard**

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard**
3. Login to your account
4. Click on your **"04ACAPPV4"** project

## âœ… **Step 2: Open SQL Editor**

1. In your project dashboard, look for **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Click on it
3. You'll see a big text area where you can write SQL

## âœ… **Step 3: Copy and Paste the Script**

1. Open the file: **`DEBUG_BYPASS_SCRIPT.sql`** (it's in your project folder)
2. **Select ALL the text** in that file (Ctrl+A)
3. **Copy it** (Ctrl+C)
4. Go back to the Supabase SQL Editor
5. **Paste the entire script** (Ctrl+V)

## âœ… **Step 4: Run the Script**

1. Look for a **"Run"** button in the SQL Editor (usually blue)
2. Click **"Run"**
3. Wait for it to complete
4. You should see results at the bottom showing:
   - "DEBUG MODE STATUS: true"
   - Functions created
   - Tables created

## âœ… **Step 5: Start Your App**

1. Go back to your PowerShell terminal
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open your app in the browser
4. Navigate to **Trial Balance** page

## âœ… **Step 6: Check the Debug Toggle**

1. In your app, look for the **Debug Toggle** in the top-right corner
2. It should show **"ENABLED"** in green
3. If it shows red, click **"Enable"**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

After completing these steps:

- âœ… **No more 403 errors** on Trial Balance
- âœ… **No more 400 errors** on projects/organizations  
- âœ… **Debug toggle visible** in top-right corner
- âœ… **Trial Balance page loads data**

## ðŸš¨ **If You Get Errors**

**Error in SQL Editor?**
- Check you copied the ENTIRE script (it's very long)
- Make sure you pasted it correctly
- Try running it again

**Still getting 400/403 errors?**
- Check the debug toggle is **ENABLED** (green)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for specific errors

**App won't start?**

- Then: `npm run dev`
